Please apply the following task to batches of inputs and return a JSON object of responses, with batch numbers as keys:

Determine whether each of the statements in {lang} language below either supports the given question (Argument_for), opposes the (Argument_against), or does not answer the question (NoArgument). Please think about the answer in the broad sense: if the statement answers "yes" to the question, assign the label Argument_for. If the statement answers "no" to the question, assign the label Argument_against.

The input statement and the question are provided within the three hashtags delimiter (###).

Your response must be a Python dictionary in the exact following format:
{
"statement": "an original given statement without any modification",
"question": "the original given question without any modification",
"label": <Argument_for,Argument_against,NoArgument>,
"reason": the reason for your answer
}
Please return only the response without any markdown.
